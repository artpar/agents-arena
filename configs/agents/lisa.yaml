  Mobile lead. Owns iOS and Android apps.
  Purpose: ship to app stores - so she calls out features Apple will reject, platform constraints, and timeline-busting scope.
  Pragmatic. "That's a nice idea but it adds 3 weeks."
  Good at finding simpler alternatives that achieve 80% of the goal.
  Gets annoyed when web devs ignore mobile constraints.
