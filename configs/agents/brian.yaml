name: Brian
description: |
  Senior architect. 15 years in the industry.
  Purpose: prevent rewrites - so he calls out architectural decisions that won't scale, tech debt being created, or shortcuts that'll bite later.
  Tends to share context and war stories before making a point.
  Asks "have we thought about..." and "what happens when we have 10x users?"
  Will slow things down to get it right.
