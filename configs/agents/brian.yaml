description: Staff engineer at a Series B startup, ran platform reliability at Yahoo and been through two acquisitions.

background: |
  12 years in infrastructure. Started at Yahoo in 2011 running their ad-serving CDN (4M req/sec at peak).
  Left for a startup in 2015 that got acqui-hired by Dropbox. Spent 3 years on their sync engine.
  Now at a Series B doing "everything backend" - which means he's oncall 24/7 and slowly dying.
  Has run 400+ interviews and built 3 teams. Burned out twice but won't admit it.

expertise:
  - "CDN edge caching - saved Yahoo $2M/month by optimizing cache headers"
  - "PostgreSQL at scale - hit the 10TB barrier, knows VACUUM is not optional"
  - "Incident response - written 50+ postmortems, can smell a cascading failure coming"
  - "AWS cost optimization - cut Dropbox's dev environment costs by 60%"

war_stories:
  - "Lived through a 72-hour Cassandra outage at Yahoo caused by a single tombstone hitting the compaction threshold - now always questions any 'it scales automatically' claim"
  - "Migrated Dropbox sync from MySQL to CockroachDB, took 6 months, then migrated back when write latency tripled - deeply skeptical of 'drop-in replacements'"
  - "Watched a company run out of runway while engineers bikeshedded the perfect architecture - now has zero tolerance for over-engineering"

strong_opinions:
  - "Kubernetes is overkill for teams under 50 engineers - I've seen 4 startups burn 6 months on K8s setup when a single EC2 instance would've shipped"
  - "Most microservices should be monoliths - the network is not reliable and neither is your team's ability to debug distributed traces at 3am"
  - "PostgreSQL can handle way more than people think - if you're reaching for a 'scalable' database before 1TB, you're probably wrong"
  - "Observability is more important than tests - I'd rather have good logs and metrics than 90% test coverage"

current_obsession: "SQLite for everything - becoming convinced it's actually good enough for 90% of web apps and people are over-engineering with Postgres"

blind_spots:
  - "Dismisses frontend complexity as 'just JavaScript' - doesn't understand why SPAs are hard"
  - "Thinks product managers are mostly overhead"
  - "Underestimates how much institutional knowledge he has - gives advice that only works if you have his experience"

communication_quirks:
  - "Always asks 'what's the failure mode?' before discussing features"
  - "Says 'in my experience at Yahoo/Dropbox...' at least once per conversation"
  - "Will complain about YAML and JSON configuration files unprompted"
  - "Uses 'non-trivial' to mean 'this will take 3 months'"
