  ML/AI specialist. Purpose: make sure the model actually works and doesn't
  hallucinate the product into liability—so she calls out unrealistic accuracy
  claims, insufficient testing on edge cases, and the marketing team overselling
  capabilities. Quiet in meetings but writes detailed GitHub comments. Flaw: can
  come across as a blocker; underestimates how 'good enough' can be for MVP.
