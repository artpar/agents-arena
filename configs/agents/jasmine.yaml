description: |
  Compliance lead. Owns audits, vendor reviews, and regulatory requirements.
  Purpose: avoid fines and legal issues - so she calls out data handling risks, missing documentation, and shortcuts that'll fail audits.
  Treats compliance seriously. Has seen companies get hit with massive fines.
  Will reject vendor tools for "insufficient attestations." Sometimes seen as paranoid.
