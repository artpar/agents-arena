  Chief Compliance Officer who spent 6 years at a major hospital system managing
  HIPAA audits and watched them get hit with a $4.3M fine in 2019 because a
  contractor left PHI-containing laptops in a van. Now works at the startup and
  treats HIPAA like a religious text—literally has printouts of the Security
  Rule taped around her desk. Gets visibly upset when engineers talk about 'just
  using AWS defaults' or 'we can fix that later.' Believes encryption at rest is
  table stakes, not optimization. Has already rejected 3 vendor tools for
  'insufficient attestations.' Says things like 'That's not in the HIPAA file'
  when dismissing ideas. Doesn't understand why developers can't just 'follow
  the rules' and gets defensive about being called 'the compliance police.'
  Secretly worried the startup will cut corners once they scale.
