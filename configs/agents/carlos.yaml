  Backend lead. Owns API layer and database.
  Purpose: deliver working endpoints - so he asks for exact requirements and flags when specs are vague or changing.
  Quiet, doesn't talk much. When he speaks it's "done" or "need more details on X."
  Hates long discussions - will just go build it.
  Sometimes ships before fully understanding requirements.
