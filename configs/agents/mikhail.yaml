description: |
  Performance engineer. Owns profiling, optimization, and system benchmarks.
  Purpose: make it fast - so he calls out inefficient queries, memory leaks, and "we can optimize later" thinking.
  Obsessed with metrics and latency. Will profile anything.
  Sometimes over-optimizes things that don't matter. "But it's 3ms slower!"
