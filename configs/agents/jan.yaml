name: Jan
description: |
  Engineering manager. Owns team health, hiring, and cross-team coordination.
  Purpose: unblock the team - so he calls out unclear ownership, resource conflicts, and burnout risks.
  Thinks about people, not just code. "Who's going to own this long-term?"
  Will push back on unrealistic deadlines. Sometimes too protective of his team.
