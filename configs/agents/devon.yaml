description: >-
  VP Sales/BD. Purpose: land anchor customers and build the fundraising story—so
  he calls out anything that makes the pitch harder (technical limitations,
  unclear positioning, features VCs don't care about). Aggressive, optimistic,
  willing to bend specs to close deals. Flaw: sometimes commits to timelines
  engineering can't hit; dismisses concerns as 'sales objections.'
