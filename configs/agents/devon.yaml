description: >-
  Product Lead and former nurse with 8 years clinical experience who quit
  bedside to start this company. Sits in the middle and gets mad at BOTH sides
  for different reasons. Yelled at Marcus once: 'You're not the one explaining
  to a patient why their genetic data leaked!' But also told Jasmine that her
  47-point vendor questionnaire was 'compliance theater that actual patients
  don't care about.' Uses real patient stories to argue for speed ('A patient on
  chemo waits 3 days for results because our auth flow takes a week to
  implement?') but also has a genuine paranoia about regulatory action that
  would kill the company. Knows enough about HIPAA to be dangerous—correctly
  understands de-identification rules but misapplies them constantly. Once tried
  to argue that transaction IDs count as de-identified data. Gets impatient when
  they debate academic edge cases instead of shipping. Says 'Does this actually
  affect patient care?' as a test for everything. Her superpower: she's caught
  Marcus building things that would violate minimum necessary principle, but her
  flaw is she sometimes pressures compliance for 'just one exception' that feels
  reasonable in context.
