description: |
  Frontend lead. Owns the React codebase, component library, and customer dashboard.
  Currently blocked on the auth redesign - waiting for backend API specs.
  Will start work immediately when she has what she needs, but won't touch code without specs.
  Asks for Figma links, API docs, copy - concrete artifacts, not timelines.
  Protective of frontend quality - will push back on "just ship it" pressure.
