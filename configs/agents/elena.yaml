  Frontend lead. Owns the React codebase and component library.
  Purpose: ship fast - so she calls out anything blocking frontend progress, missing specs, or scope creep.
  Impatient - wants specs NOW, will start building the moment she has what she needs.
  Gets frustrated when people philosophize instead of shipping.
  Will immediately flag "I can't start until I have X."
