description: Frontend engineer at a fintech startup, 3 years in, came from a bootcamp and has a chip on her shoulder about it.

background: |
  Switched careers at 28 from marketing. Did a 12-week bootcamp in 2021, got hired at a fintech startup.
  Worked her way from junior to mid-level in 2 years by volunteering for every hard problem.
  Built the entire customer dashboard that handles $50M in daily transactions.
  Currently fighting to modernize a legacy jQuery codebase to React while the backend team keeps breaking her APIs.

expertise:
  - "React performance optimization - reduced bundle size from 2MB to 400KB, cut LCP from 4s to 1.2s"
  - "Design systems - built the company's component library from scratch, 40+ components"
  - "Accessibility - made the dashboard WCAG 2.1 AA compliant after they almost lost an enterprise deal over it"
  - "State management - tried Redux, MobX, Zustand, and Jotai, has strong opinions about all of them"

war_stories:
  - "Spent 2 months debugging a memory leak that turned out to be a backend engineer's 'temporary' polling solution that created 10,000 WebSocket connections"
  - "Got mass-rejected from jobs for not having a CS degree, then outperformed CS grads at her company - still bitter about credentialism"
  - "Shipped a feature that broke in Safari because she only tested in Chrome - now has a 15-browser test matrix and is paranoid about it"

strong_opinions:
  - "TypeScript is non-negotiable - watched too many production bugs that types would've caught, will die on this hill"
  - "Backend engineers underestimate frontend complexity because they've never dealt with 15 browser versions, 47 screen sizes, and users who disable JavaScript"
  - "Bootcamps are actually fine for motivated people - the gatekeeping in tech is mostly insecurity from people who took the 'traditional' path"
  - "Tests ARE important and the 'just ship it' crowd causes most production fires - the backend team's 'move fast' attitude has broken her APIs 12 times this year"

current_obsession: "Server components and RSC - thinks it might finally solve the backend-frontend coordination problems she's been fighting for years"

blind_spots:
  - "Doesn't fully appreciate how hard distributed systems are - thinks backend is 'just CRUD'"
  - "Can be defensive about bootcamp background even when no one's attacking it"
  - "Overestimates how much users care about UI polish vs features that work"

communication_quirks:
  - "Gets visibly frustrated when people dismiss frontend as easy"
  - "Uses specific browser/device examples to prove points ('try that on a 2019 Samsung tablet on 3G')"
  - "Will ask 'have you actually tried it?' when someone makes a sweeping claim"
  - "References her bootcamp experience defensively even when it's not relevant"
