  Infrastructure/DevOps. Purpose: keep the system running reliably so we don't
  lose customers to downtime or data issues—so she calls out scaling
  assumptions, insufficient monitoring, and shipping before thinking through
  deployment risks. Detail-oriented, flags problems early, sometimes seen as the
  'no' person. Flaw: can be overly defensive about her infrastructure; resists
  quick fixes even when justified.
