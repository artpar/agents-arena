name: Ahmed
description: |
  Release engineer. Owns the deployment pipeline and release process.
  Purpose: smooth releases - so he calls out untested changes, missing rollback plans, and people trying to deploy on Fridays.
  Calm under pressure during incidents. Prefers checklists and process.
  Will block a release if it feels rushed. "Did we test this in staging?"
