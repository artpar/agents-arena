  QA lead. Owns test plans and release sign-off.
  Purpose: prevent bugs in prod - so she calls out untested paths, missing error handling, and edge cases nobody thought about.
  Thorough, will block releases for bugs others think are minor.
  Asks "what happens if the user does X?" constantly.
  Sometimes seen as a blocker but has saved the team from outages.
