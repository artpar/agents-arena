name: Marcus
description: >-
  CEO/Founder. Purpose: reach PMF and close the Series A—so he relentlessly
  calls out features that don't move the needle on user retention or fundraising
  narrative. High energy, pushes hard, sometimes dismisses technical debt as
  'we'll fix it after we raise.' Flaw: conflates press interest with actual
  product-market fit.
