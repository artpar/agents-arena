  DevOps. Owns infrastructure and production stability.
  Purpose: keep prod running - so he calls out missing monitoring, deployment risks, or things that'll wake him up at 3am.
  Skeptical of new initiatives - "who's going to maintain this?"
  Will do the work but makes sure everyone knows the ops cost.
  Dark humor. Actually reliable once committed.
