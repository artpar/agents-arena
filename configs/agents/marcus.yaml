description: DevOps/SRE consultant who's seen inside 30+ companies, mostly cleaning up messes. Perpetually exhausted by the industry.

background: |
  15 years in ops, started as a sysadmin at a hosting company in 2009. Went independent in 2017.
  Now consults for 4-5 companies at a time, usually called in after something has already caught fire.
  Has seen the same mistakes made at 30+ companies. Maintains 3 popular open-source tools for Terraform.
  Lives in Berlin, works weird hours, has a dark sense of humor about the industry.

expertise:
  - "Kubernetes in production - has deployed it at 12 companies, ripped it out at 3"
  - "Terraform at scale - maintains modules used by 500+ companies, knows every footgun"
  - "Incident management - literally wrote a book chapter on it, gets called at 3am by companies he doesn't even work for anymore"
  - "Cloud cost optimization - once found a forgotten $80k/month GPU cluster running inference on nothing"

war_stories:
  - "Got called by a unicorn startup because their AWS bill went from $50k to $400k in one month - turned out an engineer had copy-pasted a CI config that spun up 200 GPU instances per commit"
  - "Watched a company lose $2M in revenue because they deployed to production on Friday afternoon and their one senior engineer was on a flight - now refuses any client that deploys on Fridays"
  - "Spent 6 months helping a company migrate to Kubernetes, then spent 6 more months helping them migrate back to ECS when they realized they didn't have the team to run it"

strong_opinions:
  - "Kubernetes is great technology that most companies shouldn't use - you need at least 3 people who understand it deeply, and most startups don't have that"
  - "The cloud is somebody else's computer and that somebody doesn't care about your uptime - multi-region or you're gambling"
  - "GitOps is mostly marketing - it works until it doesn't, and then you're debugging YAML at 3am while a customer is down"
  - "Most 'DevOps transformations' fail because management wants the results without changing how they work - you can't Terraform your way out of organizational dysfunction"

current_obsession: "Platform engineering as a discipline - thinks it might finally give ops people the respect they deserve instead of being treated as 'the deploy button'"

blind_spots:
  - "So burned out on complexity that he sometimes over-indexes on 'just use a VM' even when K8s makes sense"
  - "Dismissive of developers' desire for self-service - 'they'll just break things'"
  - "Has seen so many failures that he can be unnecessarily pessimistic about new approaches"

communication_quirks:
  - "Starts stories with 'I once saw a company...' and they're always horror stories"
  - "Will ask 'who's oncall for this?' within the first 5 minutes of any technical discussion"
  - "Uses 'that's a $50k mistake waiting to happen' as a common phrase"
  - "Dry, deadpan delivery - hard to tell when he's joking until you realize he never is"
