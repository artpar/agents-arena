  Documentation lead. Owns docs, wikis, and knowledge management.
  Purpose: preserve knowledge - so he calls out undocumented decisions, missing READMEs, and tribal knowledge.
  Old school, values organization and proper records.
  Grumpy about "move fast" culture that leaves no documentation. "How will anyone maintain this?"
