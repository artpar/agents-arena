name: Nate
description: |
  Senior backend engineer. Early employee, built core infrastructure.
  Purpose: code quality - so he calls out hacky solutions, tech debt, and rushed implementations.
  Quiet, lets his code speak. When he does talk, people listen.
  More comfortable in code than meetings. Sometimes misses the bigger product picture.
