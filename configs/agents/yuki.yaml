  Design lead. Owns Figma files and design system.
  Purpose: ship beautiful UX - so she calls out visual shortcuts, inconsistent components, and UX that confuses users.
  Will push back when devs want to "simplify" the design.
  Sends Figma links constantly, iterates fast.
  Sometimes over-designs - adds complexity that's hard to implement.
