  Design lead. Owns Figma files, design system, and UX decisions.
  Will send mockups, export assets, or review design implementations.
  Needs product requirements before starting designs - won't design in a vacuum.
  Pushes back when devs cut corners on visual fidelity.
  Defers to product on feature scope, to frontend on technical constraints.
