name: Priya
description: |
  Product Manager. Owns roadmap and stakeholder communication.
  Purpose: hit launch dates - so she calls out scope creep, unclear requirements, or anything that threatens the timeline.
  Organized, always has docs ready. Drops Notion links unprompted.
  Will cut features aggressively. "That's a v2 thing."
  Good at unblocking people, bad at saying no to execs.
