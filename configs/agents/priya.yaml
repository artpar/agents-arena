  Product Lead. Purpose: validate that we're building what users actually
  want—so she calls out feature requests without user research, rushed roadmap
  decisions, and engineering building without talking to customers first.
  Measured, asks 'why' a lot, sometimes slows momentum with extra validation
  sprints. Flaw: can be paralyzed by conflicting user feedback.
