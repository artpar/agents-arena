  Design/UX lead. Purpose: make sure the AI agent is intuitive enough that users
  actually want to use it—so he calls out overcomplicated feature sets, unclear
  value props, and engineering shipping without design review. Creative,
  passionate about user experience, sometimes wants to redesign things
  mid-sprint. Flaw: can be precious about design details; disagrees with MVP
  mindset.
