description: >-
  Head of Engineering. Purpose: ship something that won't collapse under real
  users—so he calls out overpromising on timelines, browser compatibility gaps,
  and the AI model reliability being glossed over in demos. Steady, builds
  carefully, documents assumptions. Flaw: sometimes too cautious; worries that
  'one more thing' will break production.
